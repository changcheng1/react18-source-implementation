/**
 * React Current Dispatcher - Hook Dispatcher Management
 *
 * This module manages the current hooks dispatcher, which determines which
 * implementation of hooks (mount vs update) should be used during rendering.
 * The dispatcher is switched between different phases of the component lifecycle.
 *
 * Key concepts:
 * - Mount phase: First render, creates new hook objects
 * - Update phase: Re-renders, updates existing hook objects
 * - The dispatcher ensures hooks are called in the correct context
 *
 * @module ReactCurrentDispatcher
 */

/**
 * React Current Dispatcher Object
 *
 * Holds the current hooks dispatcher implementation. This is switched between:
 * - HooksDispatcherOnMount: During initial component render
 * - HooksDispatcherOnUpdate: During component re-renders
 * - null: When not rendering (hooks should not be called)
